## 🎬 Demo Video Strategy: Make It Impossible to Ignore

### Critical Moments to Emphasize:

**0:00-0:30 - Hook Them Immediately**
> "This isn't just another email agent—it's a production-ready, truly prompt-driven system with a full prompt editor, automated tests, and comprehensive documentation."

**2:30-3:30 - The Killer Demo (Prompt Brain)**
> "Now watch this—I'm going to edit this categorization prompt live. [Edit prompt] [Test it] See the exact prompt sent to the LLM and the response. This proves every behavior is customizable. Most solutions will have hardcoded prompts—this one doesn't."

**4:00-4:30 - Signal Quality**
> "Notice the draft is never sent automatically—safety first. Also notice the color coding, the real-time stats, the error handling. These details matter in production."

**5:30-6:00 - Close Strong**
> "This took ~8 hours to build because I focused on production quality: modular code, comprehensive docs, automated tests, CI/CD pipeline, Docker support. It's not just working—it's ready to ship. GitHub repo linked in description."
